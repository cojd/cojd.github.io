My Passion
======
I study how species interactions influence plant diversity within ecological communities and across environmental conditions. My interest in the drivers of plant diversity is grounded in a conviction that we should strive to conserve and regenerate ecosystems that provide cultural and economic benefits to humanity. Ultimately, I hope the lessons I learn will help conserve diverse plant communities for the next generation.
